				<h2>Welcome to SC Gardening</h2>

				<p>SC Gardening is Known for its professional garden services. It is a relatively new business, started in the summer of 2020. It all started when the Rylands family decided to redesign their backyard. Filling a boring and blank backyard with beautiful flowers and plants. Every time guests visited the family; they always would be amazed at how nice the backyard looked. Eventually friends and family suggested that they should offer to design other people’s yard. Soon it more and more people wanted their yard redesigned too.</p>
