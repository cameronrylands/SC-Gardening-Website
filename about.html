				<h2>About SC Gardening</h2>

				<p>SC Gardening was founded in the summer of 2020. During the summer break, the Rylands family wanted to spend more time outdoors as a family. However, there wasn’t much to do around the house. So, the family thought it would be a good idea to build a fire pit in the backyard. This was a great bonding time for the family. One project led to another and soon enough the family had a gazebo in the backyard along with many planters filled with gorgeous flowers. Because the Rylands family had a such beautiful yard they hosted many gatherings with family and friends.</p>

				<h2>mission</h2>

				<p>Through hard work dedication, the family was able to have an amazing backyard for family and friends to enjoy. This hard work and dedication are the key principle for the SC Gardening business. That’s why SC Gardening strives to provide outstanding services and go above and beyond to ensure their clients end up with a beautiful garden.</p>
